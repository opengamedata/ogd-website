           <!-- Open Science for Education Games<br /> -->
           From the logging libraries that studios can integrate into their games, all the way to the final visualizations that allow design researchers to build new theories, we are thinking about modularity, scalability and performance.</p>

                <p>We are excited about data science and analytics for learning. Games provide rich descriptions into how learners interact with complex systems. We are developing new methods to transform that raw "click steam" data into insights that can be used by researchers, designers, and educators. Open Game Data is the infrastructure that will support those discoveries.</p>

                <p class="me-md-5">Gone are the days of ad hoc, glued together analysis! Currently only large well funded groups can do this kind of research. It's time we worked together. Open data will support teams of various sizes and capacities. This project aims to expand who is able to participate.</p>
                <p class="me-md-5">We hope to accelerate the velocity of research and promote better science. You can't replicate a study if the data is closed. Open science makes research processes transparent.</p>

He's also a game designer and passionate advocate for using games to understand and transform how kids learn. David is the co-founder of the PLAY MAKE LEARN conference and the Games and Learning Summit. He serves as a PI on several research projects that explore the following topics in video games: educational data mining, co-design, mixed reality (VR, AR), and location-based games.</p>
                <p class="me-md-4">David created ARIS, an open-source game design platform that has supported the development of thousands of location-based AR projects and hundreds of educational papers. David's work supports other research, from the Open Game Data project, which shares our game data with educational researchers, to Field Day's teacher fellowship program, which serves as a site to study teachers' professional growth.</p>

                <p class="me-md-4">Erik Harpstead is a systems scientist in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where he contributes to large research projects at the intersection of LE and game design. His work focuses on design and analysis of educational games as well as novel interactive machine learning techniques for modeling the human learning process in complex domains.</p>
                <p class="me-md-4">He oversaw development of RI software projects such as Apprentice Learner Architecture, which provides tools for simulating experiments of the human learning process, and Twitch Research Toolkit, which enables researchers to execute studies on the game streaming platform Twitch.tv while abiding by relevant research ethics regulations.</p>
                <p class="me-md-4">Over the past several years, he co-led the Computational Models of Learning track at the annual Simon Initiative LearnLab Summer School hosted at CMU, which introduces researchers, practitioners, and students to cutting-edge LE techniques with the goal of expanding the broader adoption of LE practices. Harpstead also teaches classes on design of educational games, covering the integration of pedagogical content and learning science research into complex game systems.</p>

                <p class="me-md-4">She has worked on systems that model the human emotion process and that model human behaviors in mobile games as well as serious games. She developed several innovative technologies to enable designers to track and understand human behavior through game data science. This led to several papers, four best paper awards, and two books: Game Analytics: Maximizing the Value of Player Data (2013, Springer) and Game Data Science (2012, Oxford University Press). She investigates how users can use data of their play and others' play in learning games to enhance self-regulated learning and reflection.</p>
