We conducted a 2x2 randomized experiment with 11,804 anonymous 3rd-6th grade students. Using one-way ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis tests, we find that changes to the script produced measurable results in the self-reported perceived humor of the game and the likeability of the player character. Different scripts did not produce significant differences in player completion of the game, or how much of the game was played. Perceived humor and enjoyment of the game and its main character contributed significantly to progress in the game, as did self-perceived reading skill.",

Recently, there has been increased interest in identifying the different engagement profiles of learners playing games, descriptions of groups of learners’ tendencies and preferences when playing digital games. These engagement profiles represent a powerful tool for designers looking to create personalized and adaptive learning environments. In this work, we explore two aspects of these engagement profiles. First, we explore the different profiles of engagement in a large sample of elementary and middle school learners playing the history game Jo Wilder and the Capitol Case (2019) in a variety of contexts, using the data from a self-report survey. Second, we explore the effect that minor game dialogue changes had on learners’ perceptions of different game elements, such as character likeability and humor, as well as personal preferences, such as enjoyment of history. These findings highlight opportunities for personalized and adaptive game design that leverage players’ goals and motivations.",

We analyze post-gameplay survey and interview data to understand teachers' experiences with the tool in terms of evidence of co-design, feasibility, and effectiveness. Our results indicate the participatory design yielded a tool both useful for and usable by teachers within the context of a real class gameplay session.
