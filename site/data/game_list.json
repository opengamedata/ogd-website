In this paper, we present a struggle detector in the context of students playing the learning game, Wake: Tales from the Aqualab. Using the interaction log data of the game, we engineered four sets of features that captured distinct aspects of gameplay and trained prediction models to identify human-coded cases of students struggling, cross-validating at the student level. Our best-performing detectors have shown some capability in identifying student struggles with modest performance, at an AUC (Area Under the Curve) value of 0.635. We discuss current limitations of this approach, as well as next steps towards providing real-time support within the game.",

Using one-way ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis tests, we find that changes to the script produced measurable results in the self-reported perceived humor of the game and the likeability of the player character. Different scripts did not produce significant differences in player completion of the game, or how much of the game was played. Perceived humor and enjoyment of the game and its main character contributed significantly to progress in the game, as did self-perceived reading skill.",

Recently, there has been increased interest in identifying the different engagement profiles of learners playing games, descriptions of groups of learners’ tendencies and preferences when playing digital games. These engagement profiles represent a powerful tool for designers looking to create personalized and adaptive learning environments. In this work, we explore two aspects of these engagement profiles. First, we explore the different profiles of engagement in a large sample of elementary and middle school learners playing the history game Jo Wilder and the Capitol Case (2019) in a variety of contexts, using the data from a self-report survey. Second, we explore the effect that minor game dialogue changes had on learners’ perceptions of different game elements, such as character likeability and humor, as well as personal preferences, such as enjoyment of history. These findings highlight opportunities for personalized and adaptive game design that leverage players’ goals and motivations.",

In this paper we present a simple, reusable process using best practices for data clustering, feasible for use within a small educational game studio. We utilize the method to analyze a real-time strategy game, processing game telemetry data to determine categories of players based on their in-game actions, the feedback they received, and their progress through the game.

                "abstract": "Educational games are an increasingly popular teaching tool in modern classrooms. However, the development of complementary tools for teachers facilitating classroom gameplay is lacking. We present the results of a participatory design process for a teacher-facing, real-time game data dashboard. This two-phase process included a workshop to elicit teachers' requirements for such a tool, and a pilot study of our dashboard prototype. We analyze post-gameplay survey and interview data to understand teachers' experiences with the tool in terms of evidence of co-design, feasibility, and effectiveness. Our results indicate the participatory design yielded a tool both useful for and usable by teachers within the context of a real class gameplay session. We advocate for the continued development of data-driven teacher tools to improve the effectiveness of games deployed in the classroom.",

In this study we describe Waddle, a virtual reality (VR) experience designed to facilitate the direct embodiment of an Adélie Penguin moving through the key stages of their life cycle as an intervention to increase empathy. By collecting pre and post questionnaire data from forty-three grade 3 through 8 students attending a science festival, we find that Waddle was successful in facilitating an embodied experience and supported a significant increase in the participants’ empathy toward penguins. We also find that greater embodiment was correlated with increased empathy, suggesting a casual relation that invites additional research into designing embodied experiences using immersive technologies as a method for developing empathy and fostering greater social engagement.",
